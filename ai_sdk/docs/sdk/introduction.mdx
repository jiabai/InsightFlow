## Why another SDK?

Python is the defacto language for AI. However, to actually get started with AI, you'll need to 1. use a bloated external framework and install a bunch of dependencies, or 2. use an incredibly confusing API client (to simply call an LLM, you need `client.chat.completions.create(**kwargs).result.choices[0].message.content`).

### Features

- Zero-configuration functions that work consistently across providers.
- First-class **streaming** & **tool-calling** support.
- <strong>Strong Pydantic types</strong> throughout - you know exactly what you're getting.
- <strong>Strict</strong> structured-output generation and streaming via Pydantic models.
- Provider-agnostic embeddings with built-in batching & retry logic.
- Tiny dependency footprint - no bloated external frameworks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-sdk-python
# or
uv add ai-sdk-python
```

That's it - no extra build steps or config files.

## Quick-start

Get started in just a few lines of code.

```python generate_text.py lines icon="python"
from ai_sdk import openai, generate_text

res = generate_text(
  model=openai("gpt-4.1"),
  prompt="Tell me a haiku about Python",
)

print(res.text)
```
