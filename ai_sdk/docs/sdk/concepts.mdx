## Mission

`ai_sdk` aims to **minimise boilerplate** when working with modern LLMs while staying _provider-agnostic_ and fully **typed**.

1. One-line helpers (`generate_text`, `embed_many`, …) do 90 % of common work.
2. Abstract base classes (`LanguageModel`, `EmbeddingModel`) keep providers pluggable.
3. Pydantic models enforce type-safety for structured output & internal messages.
4. Everything is sync-first for notebooks/scripts but exposes async streaming where it matters.

## High-level flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Factory helper returns a provider wrapper">

```python
model = openai("gpt-4.1-mini")
```

</Step>
<Step title="Helper builds a provider-agnostic request">

The SDK translates <code>prompt/system/messages/tools</code> into the provider’s native schema.

</Step>
<Step title="Provider SDK call & response normalisation">

Each provider implementation maps the raw response back into a lightweight dict containing
`text`, `finish_reason`, `usage`, `raw_response`, …

</Step>
<Step title="Result objects give you typed access">

```python
GenerateTextResult
├─ text: str
├─ usage: TokenUsage
└─ tool_calls / tool_results (optional)
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Where does retry logic live?

- **Embeddings** - batching & retries happen in the _helper_ (`embed_many`).
- **Text generation** - delegate retries to the provider's SDK since most include back-off handlers.

## Extending the SDK

1. Implement `LanguageModel` or `EmbeddingModel`.
2. Expose a public factory (e.g. `mycloud(model="x")`).
3. Users instantly get the full helper surface - no changes elsewhere.

<Tip>
  Keeping the abstraction layer razor-thin (less than 100 LOC per provider) makes it easy for the
  community to add new backends.
</Tip>

## Roadmap

- Built-in vector-store utilities
- Native image generation helpers
- Automatic schema extraction for `generate_object`
